Problem 1: Sorting Employees (Easy Level)
    Description: Write a Java program to sort a list of Employee objects using lambda expressions. 
    Each Employee object should have the following attributes:

INPUT:
    List<Employee> employees = Arrays.asList(
        new Employee("John", 30, 50000),
        new Employee("Alice", 25, 60000),
        new Employee("Bob", 35, 45000)
    );

OUTPUT:
    Employee{name='Bob', age=35, salary=45000.0}
    Employee{name='John', age=30, salary=50000.0}
    Employee{name='Alice', age=25, salary=60000.0}


Problem 2: Filtering and Sorting Students (Medium Level)
    Description: Create a Java program that uses lambda expressions and stream operations to:
    a-> Filter students who scored above 75%
    b-> Sort them by marks in descending order
    c-> Display their names

INPUT:
    List<Student> students = Arrays.asList(
        new Student("Emma", 85),
        new Student("Liam", 72),
        new Student("Olivia", 90),
        new Student("Noah", 78)
    );

OUTPUT:
    Olivia
    Emma
    Noah


Problem 3: Processing a Large Dataset of Products (Hard Level)
    Description: Write a Java program to process a dataset of products using streams. Perform the following operations:
    a-> Group products by category
    b-> Find the most expensive product in each category
    c-> Calculate the average price of all products

INPUT:
    List<Product> products = Arrays.asList(
        new Product("Laptop", "Electronics", 75000),
        new Product("Smartphone", "Electronics", 50000),
        new Product("Table", "Furniture", 10000),
        new Product("Chair", "Furniture", 5000)
    );

OUTPUT:
    Most Expensive Product per Category:
    Electronics: Laptop (75000.0)
    Furniture: Table (10000.0)

    Average Price of All Products: 35000.0
